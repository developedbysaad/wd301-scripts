To work on a React application, there is little bit of setup we've to do in our computer.

First, we've to install/update Node.Js on our computer. Because, we're going to use Node to actually generate a React project.

I'm assuming that you've already completed the [Web Development 201 course](https://www.pupilfirst.school/courses/1804/curriculum) and there you've installed Node.Js in your computer using NVM.

To check the current version of Node.Js installed in your system, you can run the following command:
```sh
node -v
```

If you are getting a version number, that means you already have Node installed and you do not need to reinstall it. It doesn't really matter what version you have, any modern Node version will work fine.

### Update the Node.Js version (optional)
Now if you see, the version of Node installed in your computer needs to be updated, you can use the following NVM command to get the list of all available versions:
```sh
nvm ls-remote
```

To install a LTS version of Node.Js, just run:
```sh
nvm install --lts
```

Or if you want, you can also install any specific version as well:
```sh
nvm install 18
```

Thatâ€™s it, your system is totally ready for starting your learning journey with React.js. See you in the next lesson.
