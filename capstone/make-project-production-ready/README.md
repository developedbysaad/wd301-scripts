# Capstone Production Checklist

In order to develop a production-ready React application, it's important to consider various aspects such as performance, security, browser compatibility, and user experience. This checklist provides a set of basic and necessary requirements that is expected to be implemented while building your React Capstone application.

## Checklist

### Packaging and Bundling

- [ ] Implemented code splitting/lazy loading to load only necessary code for each page or component.
- [ ] Optimize and compress static assets like images, fonts, and icons. Use [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) when possible.

### Application Performance

- [ ] Utilize React's virtual DOM efficiently to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- [ ] Optimize expensive operations such as heavy computations or large data manipulations.
- [ ] Optimize application performance and verify the same with tools like [Lighthouse Audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools).

### Security Considerations

- [ ] Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Verify transmission of all data securely over HTTPS, especially for sensitive data or authentication.

### Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Test the application on multiple browsers and versions for [compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing).

### User Experience (UX)

- [ ] Create if possible, a design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- [ ] Optimize performance for fast load times and smooth interactions.
- [ ] Maintain consistent design language and navigation structure throughout the application.
- [ ] Provide clear error handling and feedback messages to users.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

- [ ] Enable a service worker to provide offline functionality and caching of assets.
- [ ] Implement a web app manifest file (`manifest.json`) for installing the app on users' devices.
- [ ] Configure the app to display an [app-like experience](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/19703) with a standalone mode and a custom icon on the home screen.

Happy coding!!!
