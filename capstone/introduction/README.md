# React Capstone Project: Sports News and Scores Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the final level of the React course! In this capstone project, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of React concepts by developing a Sports News and Scores Dashboard from scratch. The goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to browse sports news, view live scores, and personalize their dashboard based on their preferences.

## What is the Sports News and Scores Dashboard?

The Sports News and Scores Dashboard is a web application that provides users with up-to-date sports news articles and live scores for various sports. It allows users to stay informed about their favourite sports, read news articles, and track live match scores, all in one place. Additionally, users can personalize their dashboard by selecting their favourite sports or teams to receive tailored news and score updates.

## Personas

To better understand the target users and their needs, let's consider two personas for the Sports News and Scores Dashboard:

1. **Sports Enthusiast**: This persona represents users who are passionate about sports and want to stay updated with the latest news and scores across various sports. They enjoy reading news articles and following live matches for their favourite sports or teams.

2. **Casual User**: This persona represents users who have a general interest in sports, but may not be as dedicated as sports enthusiasts. They want to access sports news and scores occasionally, and may have specific sports or teams they are interested in.

Each of these personas will have different requirements and expectations from the Sports News and Scores Dashboard, and we need to cater to both to create a user-friendly and engaging application.

## Required Features

Based on the user stories and project goals, the following features are required for the Sports News and Scores Dashboard:

1. Browse Sports News:

- Users should be able to view a list of sports news articles.
- Each news article should display the title, summary, and thumbnail image.
- Users should be able to click on a news article to read the full content.

2. Filter News Articles:

- Users should have the ability to filter news articles by sport.
- The filtered news articles should dynamically update without a page reload.

3. View Live Scores and Match Details:

- Users should be able to see a list of ongoing matches and their respective scores.
- Each match should display the teams playing, the current score, and other relevant match details.
- Users should have the option to manually refresh the scores.

4. Personalize Dashboard:

- Users should be able to create an account and sign in to the dashboard.
- Signed-in users should have the ability to customize their dashboard preferences.
- Preferences may include selecting favourite sports or teams to receive tailored news and score updates.

## Optional Features

While the above features are the core requirements, you can always add more features to enhance the application. Here are a few optional features to consider:

- Allow users to save favourite news articles and matches.
- Implement the ability for users to change their account passwords.

These optional features can further enhance the user experience and provide additional functionality to the Sports News and Scores Dashboard.

## Conclusion

The Sports News and Scores Dashboard project will challenge you to utilize your React skills to create a dynamic and engaging web application. By implementing the required features and exploring optional enhancements, you will gain practical experience in building a production-ready React app.

Please refer to the user stories document for a more detailed breakdown of each feature's requirements and expected behaviour.

Good luck with your capstone project, and enjoy building the Sports News and Scores Dashboard!
