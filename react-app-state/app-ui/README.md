In this video, we will create a theme for our Smarter Tasks application using TailwindCSS and daisyUI.

Step 1: Install and configure Flowbite
Now, let me introduce you to daisyUI. It's a completely open source UI library, with over 600+ UI components, sections, and pages, which is build built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

In our project we aleready have the TailwindCSS installed and configured. Next, we have to install Flowbite and it's react counterpart (flowbite-react) in our project. For that, we will run the following command in our terminal (ofcourse inside our project folder):

npm install flowbite flowbite-react --save
Once it's installed, we will require Flowbite as a plugin inside your tailwind.config.js file:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('flowbite/plugin')
  ]
}
So, we are all set to use these flowbite React components in our project.
