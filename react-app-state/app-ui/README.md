In this video, we will enhance the visual appeal of our Smarter Tasks application using TailwindCSS and [headlessUI](https://headlessui.com/). 

headlessUI is a powerful library of UI components that simplifies the development process by providing pre-built components with built-in JavaScript functionality. These components, such as dialogs and dropdowns, come with ready-to-use logic, eliminating the need for us to write the code from scratch. While headlessUI offers a limited set of components on their website, we will find that it includes everything necessary to elevate the user experience of our Smarter Tasks application.

### Step 1: Install and configure headlessUI
In our project we aleready have the TailwindCSS installed and configured. Next, we have to install headlessUI in our project. For that, we will run the following command in our terminal (ofcourse inside our project folder):

```sh
npm install @headlessui/react --save
```

Then,

### Step 2: Install heroicons library
In our project, we will integrate the [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)  library to enhance the visual representation of icons. Heroicons provides a wide range of beautifully designed icons that can be easily integrated into our application. To install heroicons, we will run the following command in terminal:

```sh
npm install @heroicons/react --save
```
