## Other UI Library Options

### Material-UI

Material-UI is a comprehensive UI library that implements the Material Design principles. It offers a wide range of pre-styled and visually appealing components.

Material-UI provides a vast collection of pre-designed and pre-styled components, making it easy to create visually appealing interfaces quickly.

It also offers a robust theming system that allows developers to customize the components' appearance and styles to match their brand or application design.

The library also benefits from a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, support, and a variety of community-contributed resources.

### Ant Design

Ant Design is a popular UI library known for its comprehensive set of components with a minimalist and modern design.

Ant Design follows the Ant Design Language, which promotes simplicity, consistency, and a clean user experience.

This also offers extensive support for internationalization, making it easier to create multilingual applications.

The most important feature here includes a range of enterprise-level components, such as tables, forms, and charts, which are well-suited for building complex business applications.

### Chakra UI

Chakra UI is a modular and accessible UI library that focuses on developer experience and speed of development.

Chakra UI provides a simple and intuitive API that accelerates the development process and reduces boilerplate code.

It offers a theming system and a style props API, making it effortless to customize and style components according to project requirements.

This also does emphasize accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring that components work seamlessly across different devices and comply with accessibility standards.
