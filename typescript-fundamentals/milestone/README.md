## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make the following changes in the *Smarter Tasks* React application:
1. Migrate the entire *Smarter Tasks* React application to TypeScript following the previous lessons.
2. The props `dueDate`, `completedAtDate` and `assigneeName` that are passed from the `App` component and to the `TaskCard` component should be defined through an TypeScript interface.

One important point to note here is that, the task cards present in `Pending` list should now show the *completed on* and the tasks present in `Done` list should not show the `due date`. Means you have to apply some logic in the `TaskCard` component to make it work.

## Submission Requirements
1. Use the same public repository as your previous level submission in your GitHub account.
2. After the implementation, commit your changes, and push the code to this GitHub repository.

#### Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - keep proper indentation and add relevant comments if required. This one is non-negotiable as always.

Have fun!
