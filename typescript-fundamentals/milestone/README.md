## Problem Description

To complete this milestone, you have to make the following changes in the `hello-react` React application from the earlier level:
1. Migrate the entire React application (`hello-react`) to TypeScript following the [previous lesson](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/19358).
2. The props `dueDate`, `completedAtDate` and `assigneeName` that are passed from the `App` component and to the `TaskCard` component should be defined through a TypeScript interface.

## Submission Requirements

1. Use the same public repository as your previous level submission, i.e., `wd301` in your GitHub account.
2. After the implementation, commit your changes, and push the code to this GitHub repository.

## Repo structure

At this point in the course, this is how your repo should be structured:

```
.
├── hello-react
|   ├── public
|   ├── src
|   |   ├── App.tsx
|   |   ├── index.css
|   |   ├── main.tsx
|   |   ├── TaskCard.tsx
|   |   └── TaskCard.css
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── postcss.config.js
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── vite.config.js
└── .gitignore

```
Note that there may be other files in the repo apart from the ones we have listed above, and that's fine. 

#### Well-formatted code is a must.

Remember to format the code - use proper indentation and add relevant comments if required. This one is non-negotiable, as always.

Have fun!
