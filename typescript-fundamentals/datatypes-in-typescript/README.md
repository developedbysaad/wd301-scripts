In this lesson, we will learn about the `any`, `void` and `never` data types in TypeScript. The `any` data type is a special type that can be used to opt out of TypeScript's type-checking system. It's useful in cases where you don't know the type of value ahead of time, or where you want to disable type-checking for a specific variable or expression. The `void` and `never` data types are used to represent the absence of a value.

To use the `any` data type, you simply need to annotate the variable or expression with any. For example, try writing the following code in your `main.ts`:

```js
let name: any = "hello";
name = 42;
name = false;
```

In this example, the variable `name` is declared as type `any`, which means it can hold any type of value. As a result, we can assign it a `string`, a `number`, and a `boolean` value without any errors being thrown.

The `void` type represents the absence of any type. It is commonly used as the return type of function that does not return a value. Add the below code to your `main.ts` file:

```js
function printHello(): void {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In this example, the `printHello` function does not return a value, so its return type is `void`. If we try to return a value from this function, TypeScript will give us an error:

```js
function printHello(): void {
  console.log("Hello!");
  return "hello"; // TypeScript will give an error here
}
```

The `never` type represents the absence of a value, but it indicates that the function will never return. This is useful for representing functions that throw an error or never terminate. Add the below code to your `main.ts` file:

```js
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error("An error occurred!");
}
```

In this example, the `throwError` function never returns because it always throws an error. Therefore, its return type is `never`.

It's important to note that using the `any` data type can disable many of the benefits of using TypeScript, such as improved code reliability and better code maintainability. As a result, it's generally best to restrict the use of `any` data type to a minimum and only when absolutely necessary.

Using these types in TypeScript can help you catch errors in your code and ensure that your functions are working as intended.

See you in the next lesson!
