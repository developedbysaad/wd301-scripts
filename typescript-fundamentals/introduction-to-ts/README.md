Welcome. In this level, we will learn about TypeScript. TypeScript is a popular programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. This means that it contains all the functionality of JavaScript and adds some additional features on top of it.

One of the main benefits of using TypeScript is that it allows you to catch errors in your code before you even run it. This is because TypeScript adds a layer of _type checking_ to your code, which can help you identify issues such as incorrect function arguments or incompatible variable assignments. This can save you a lot of time and effort in debugging your code, especially as your codebase grows in size and complexity.

Another advantage of TypeScript is that it is easier to read and understand than plain JavaScript, especially for larger codebases. This is because TypeScript allows you to add type annotations to your variables and functions. This can make it clear to other developers what kind of data a function is expecting or what type of value a variable is holding.

There are some key reasons why using Typescript is suggested, few are as follows:

**Improved code reliability**: As mentioned, the type checking in TypeScript can help you catch errors before you even run your code, saving you time and effort in debugging.

**Better code maintainability**: The added type annotations in TypeScript can make it easier for other developers (or even yourself) to understand and maintain your code, especially as it grows.

**Enhanced code editor support**: Many code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in support for TypeScript, which can make it easier to write and navigate your code.

In summary, TypeScript is a popular programming language that adds a layer of type checking and improved readability to JavaScript. It can help you write more reliable, maintainable, and easily understandable code, and is supported by many popular code editors.

Let us learn more about how to write Typescript code and how to execute it in the upcoming lessons.
